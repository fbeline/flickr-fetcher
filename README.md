## Developing

1. Start a new REPL: `lein repl`
2. Start the service in dev-mode: `(def dev-serv (run-dev))`
3. Connect your editor to the running REPL session.
   Re-evaluated code will be seen immediately in the service.

### [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container support

1. Configure your service to accept incoming connections (edit service.clj and add  ::http/host "0.0.0.0" )
2. Build an uberjar of your service: `lein uberjar`
3. Build a Docker image: `sudo docker build -t flickr-fetcher .`
4. Run your Docker image: `docker run -p 8080:8080 flickr-fetcher`

### [OSv](http://osv.io/) unikernel support with [Capstan](http://osv.io/capstan/)

1. Build and run your image: `capstan run -f "8080:8080"`

Once the image it built, it's cached.  To delete the image and build a new one:

1. `capstan rmi flickr-fetcher; capstan build`
